When last worked on 1-2 years ago, the jstr library was functional, but I
    preferred to have some more documentation and support of auxilliary yet
    useful function; I don't recall if I finished the functions, but
    documentation was in progress at least.

I've re-organized everything, databases in one folder, jstr itself in its own
    folder, and creator.cpp was the originally the file I tested with. That's
    been renamed to jstrDevTest.cpp, and an equivalent script was created to
    run it. The new creator.cpp will have the language creation tools.
